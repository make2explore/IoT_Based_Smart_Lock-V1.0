üî¥ Project Name : IoT based Smart Door Lock  

<br  />

üì∑ About Project -  

üö©   In this project we've build IoT based smart door lock which have 3 layers of access. RFID + PIN + OTP.  

üö©   We‚Äôve also implemented Data logging. Valid Entry through door will be recorded in Google Sheet.  

üö©   Particle Cloud webhook integration is used to generate OTP using Telegram Bot. Google Sheet data logging also uses webhook.  

üö©   This is IoT based project uses Particle photon Development Board. hence you can update its firmware from anywhere using particle cloud console.  

üö©   Nextion Touchscreen HMI Display is used for interacting with this door lock.
